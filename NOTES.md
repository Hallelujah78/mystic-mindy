# Style/Layout

- copy this, seems good for something simple

- when you click button to fetch fortune, have dog bark + wiggle the image of the dog

- Click the Crystal Ball to receive the gift of my wisdom

- I have been known by many names throughout the eons: some call me Mindy Moo, others Mindy the
  Moosicle.
  Some, for reasons best left unsaid, refer to me as Pooprah Winfrey. Anyhoo, I'm a bit psychic so
  feel
  free to ask me your fortune!

- services tab
  - available for exorcisms _new_

# To Do

- light/dark favicons for preferred theme
- the fortune "manuscript" remembers where the user has scrolled to
  - subsequent fortune retrieval means the fortune is scrolled to the bottom when it is opened
- disable scrolling and/or force scroll to top of the main page when we click the crystal ball
